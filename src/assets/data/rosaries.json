Tradition holds that Mary appeared to him in 1221 and gave him the devotion of the Rosary, encouraging him to share the prayer with others.

While some people prefer to pray with beads, they aren’t necessary for our time spent with Jesus and Mary. Praying the full Rosary step by step usually takes about 15 – 25 minutes, but remember, you can always simply pray one decade (an Our Father, 10 Hail Mary’s, a Glory Be) if that’s all the time you have.\nIf you’re looking to add the Rosary to your prayer routine intentionally, consider the following times for prayer:\nIf you take daily walks, consider adding the Rosary to your routine.

The reason behind the Rosary is fairly simple — Mary was present for the joyful, sorrowful, luminous, and glorious moments of Christ’s life. So, by meditating on Jesus’ life with Mary’s help,we seek to grow closer and closer to Christ. We might pray with Mary for a special intention, or we might need a moment of solace with the Blessed Mother and her Son. Any reason to pray the Rosary is a beautiful reason.\nThe Rosary is a great weapon against evil — be it evil from without, or evil from within our own hearts. Bishop Hugh Boyle famously remarked, “No one can live continually in sin and continue to say the Rosary. Either he will give up the sin or he will give up the Rosary”."},{"question":"What is the origin and meaning of the word “Rosary”?","answer":"The Latin word for “Rosary” is Rosarium. Originally, rosarium simply meant “rose garden“. (3) How the Catholic prayer beads came to be associated with a rose garden is not entirely clear, but Catholic tradition honors the rose as a symbol of the Virgin Mary, to whom the Rosary is specially devoted. \nThrough the ages, Catholic writers have likened the recitation of the Rosary to an offering of roses to the Blessed Mother, with each prayer representing a rose, and the Rosary itself symbolizing a garland. (4)"},{"question":"Which prayers are recited in the Rosary?","answer":"The Rosary consists of 150 Hail Marys, 15 Our Fathers, and a series of meditations upon 15 Sacred Mysteries, representing fifteen significant events in the lives of Jesus and Mary.\nOther types of Catholic prayer beads are sometimes called “rosaries”, but this usage is not quite accurate. These other devotions are perfectly valid, but the Church does not call them “rosaries”. When official Church documents speak of the “Rosary”, they invariably mean the Dominican Rosary of 150 Hail Marys, 15 Our Fathers and 15 Sacred Mysteries.\n"},{"question":"Does the Church set rules concerning the Rosary?","answer":"The Rosary is a private devotion, whose method of practice is subject to a wide range of personal choice. However, the Church does set minimal standards as to what constitutes a Rosary. It defines a Rosary as the praying of 150 Hail Marys, 15 Our Fathers, and meditation upon the 15 Sacred Mysteries. If you leave out any of the above, you are not praying an actual Rosary as defined by the Church. Other prayers and meditations can be added to those mentioned above, according to local custom or personal choice, but such additions are considered optional."},{"question":"Why should we sing the Rosary instead of just reciting it?","answer":"It is of course commendable to recite any prayer, including the Rosary, in a plain voice, without song. However, sages and saints, from earliest times, have taught that singing a prayer is more powerful than speaking it — a teaching summarized in the famous Roman maxim, “He who sings well prays twice”. (Qui bene cantat, bis orat.)\nSt. Augustine of Hippo expanded upon this theme when he wrote:“He who sings praise, does not only praise, but also praises joyfully; he who sings praise, not only sings, but also loves Him about whom he sings.” (Qui enim cantat laudem, non solum laudat, sed etiam hilariter laudat; qui cantat laudem, non solum cantat, sed et amat eum quem cantat.) (5)\nThe Church teaches that Gregorian chant is a form of music “specially suited to the Roman liturgy“. (6) While the Rosary is not a public liturgy, but rather a private devotion, many of its prayers are identical with those used in the Mass. Indeed, Pope John Paul II called the Rosary, “a faithful echo of the Liturgy“. (7) Gregorian chant therefore seems well-suited for singing the Rosary.\n"},{"question":"What is Gregorian chant?","answer":"Gregorian chant is the traditional liturgical music of the Roman Catholic Church. It has been used for centuries to sing the Mass and for other types of worship services.\nGregorian chant is derived from a much older and larger family of music called plainchant or plainsong (from the Latin cantus planus). In its strictest form, plainchant allows no instruments other than the human voice. The music follows a single melody line, with no harmonizing. Every singer in the choir chants the same tune in unison.\nPlainchant existed long before Christianity. Extremely ancient versions of plainchant still survive in the ceremonies of Jews, Armenians and the Coptic Christians of Egypt, for example.\nEarly Christians adopted plainchant for their worship. Many varieties developed within the Church. In the East, the Byzantine, Coptic and Armenian styles flourished. In the West, the Roman style gained ascendancy.\nGregorian chant descends directly from the Roman or Old Roman style of plainchant. By the time of Pope Gregory the Great (AD 590 – 604), a number of regional chanting styles had developed within the Western Church, such as the Gallican (in the province of Gaul), Ambrosian (in northern Italy), Celtic (in the British Isles) and Mozarabic (in Spain). (8)\nPope Gregory the Great compiled the chants of the Old Roman liturgy, and established a schola cantorum in Rome — a school of singing — which propagated the Old Roman style of plainchant across the Empire. Over time, the Roman or “Gregorian” style spread throughout the Western Church, replacing other regional styles. (9)\n"},{"question":"Did medieval people sing the Rosary in Gregorian chant?","answer":"Evidently they did. Historical literature abounds with references to “singing” or “chanting” the Rosary, as distinct from “saying” or “reciting” it. For example, St. Louis de Montfort writes, “There are several ways of saying the Holy Rosary, but that which gives Almighty God the greatest glory… is that of saying or chanting the Rosary publicly in two groups (c’est de le psalmodier ou réciter publiquement à deux choeurs).” (10) Significantly, De Montfort does not use the verb chanter (“to sing”) in this passage, but rather psalmodier, a term of art specific to the singing of liturgical chant. Its literal meaning is “to Psalmodize” or to sing Psalms."}]},{"name":"Divine Mercy Chaplet","timeNeeded":"5 minutes","wordFromPopeFrancis":"Dear brothers and sisters, let us be renewed by the peace, forgiveness and wounds of the merciful Jesus.

When they say this Chaplet in the presence of the dying, I will stand between My Father and the dying person, not as the just Judge but as the Merciful Savior.

Before her untimely death, Marie Claire did just that, traveling widely to teach it to thousands of people, who then taught it to thousands of others. (Marie-Claire was killed in the genocide of over a million people in Rwanda, a tragedy that was foretold through visions of rivers of blood that the young people in Kibeho received several years before the killings.)\n\nShe (the Holy Virgin) promised that when prayed with an open and repentant heart, the rosary would win us the Lord's forgiveness for our sins and free our souls from guilt and remorse.
